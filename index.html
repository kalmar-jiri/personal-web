                <h3>Reading</h3>
                <p>I have a passion for reading in which I seek education, entertainment but also an escape from everyday's cluttered world. One of my goals in life is to build
                  a giant bookcase filled from top to bottom. The books that influenced me in my life the most would probably be <em>12 Rules for Life, Alchemist, Moonwalking 
                    with Einstein, Deep Work</em> or <em>Tao Te Ching.</em>

                <h3>Computers</h3>
                <p>I love everything related to computers. That would explain why I spent most of my childhood in front of one. I like reading about technologies, playing videogames
                  and now I enjoy my freshly found passion for programming. I'm at the begginning of my road but I am doing my reps. One day at the time.

                <h3>Volleyball</h3>
                <p>A surprise, to be sure, but a welcome one. I have never thought I could love sport so much until I started playing volleyball. For me the benefits are literally bottomless as I have met and became friends with wonderful people, witnessed
                  and played in beautiful matches and also met with the love of my life.
